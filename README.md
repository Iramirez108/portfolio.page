I made a portfolio webpage to show so far what I have learned. I have made seperate tabs for "about me" "contact" "work" and "resume".
Each tab that you click on will scroll the windown down to that page that you clicked. 
I tailored the webpage as best as I could given all that I have learned in html and css.
There is a picture of me that is the most up to date picture and a quick bio.
